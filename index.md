# Welcome to Azure DocKit Documentation

Azure DocKit automatically generates technical documentation of your Azure environment, including complete Visio diagrams, dependencies, track changes, best practices warnings, billing info (CSPs and EAs included) and more.

It works in both environment, classical and ARM. Azure DocKit also gives the ability to receive emails that contain executive information and changes since the last document generation.

Azure DocKit comes with a Word-Add In to enter your own documentation so that it will be automatically reinserted the next time you generate the document.

This website objective is to help you use Azure DocKit. It is divided in the following sections:

* [Getting Started](/GettingStarted)
* [Features](/Features)
* [Options](/Options)
* [FAQ](/FAQ)
* [Troubleshooting](/Troubleshooting)
