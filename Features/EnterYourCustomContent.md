# Enter Custom Content in your document

Azure DocKit gives you the ability to enter custom content in the generated document.

By using this feature, you will be able to enter additional content like the description of a Web App or a SLA or any content you want and ensure that it gets embedded in the document every time you regenerate the documentation.

***Warning***

**
In order to use this feature, you have to use your own blob storage (ARM) so that Azure DocKit has a place where to store your custom content. You can refer to [the options page](https://azuredockit.github.io/Options) to see how to use your own blob storage.
**

Then, you can contact us to get the Add-In. We are currently in the process of publishing directly the Add-In to the store but in the meantime, we provide a side loading option for users that want to test it.

In order to Side Load, you can refer to  [this link](https://dev.office.com/docs/add-ins/testing/create-a-network-shared-folder-catalog-for-task-pane-and-content-add-ins) 

Then once you activate the Add In, you have to login first and then you will be able to click on Insert Documenation to create content.
